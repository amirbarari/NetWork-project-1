# NetWork-project-1
In this project, I have to design a server and client that, when the client is executed, will act as a malware and connect to the server. The server is able to take control of the input and output of PowerShell and perform tasks such as getting information, sending information, deleting information, etc. I design this program with c++ language and qt framework.
